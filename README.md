# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
My library of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python.

The coursera course was taught in GNU Octave, and this repository contains the python versions of the problems and techniques. Most of my scikit-learn code is tested on the cancer dataset, which comes built in with the scikit-learn library.
